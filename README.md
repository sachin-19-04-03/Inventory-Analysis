# Inventory-Analysis
Built an end-to-end retail analytics solution covering inventory movement, sales performance, and vendor costs. Used Python chunk-based aggregation to handle large datasets efficiently. Analyzed opening vs closing stock, classified fast/slow movers, compared vendor spend and prices, and delivered insights via an interactive Power BI dashboard.
